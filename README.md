## A C++ game which can be played in a terminal based on Hasbro's Battleship.  
  
> This is a simple game I made during my freshman year hence the code sucks but works.  
> But to be honest, looking at it now, I'm kinda impressed of the effort I put it in to include the sounds  
> and animate for a game in a terminal for a newb so I'm just committing this for safekeeping or memories :)
